A simple macOS utility to select, combine, and copy file contents, especially useful for providing context to **Large
Language Models (LLMs)** and **Generative AI** coding assistants. Includes history tracking.

## Features

- Select files from a directory or via drag-and-drop from Finder Pycharm (jetbrains IDEs) project navigation, etc.
- Display concatenated content from selected files, formatted for easy copying.
- Smartly extract specific Python classes/functions.
- **Navigate history**: Use Back/Forward buttons to revisit previous file selections and generated text outputs.
- **Detect stale content**: Indicates if file contents have changed on disk since a history state was captured.
- Copy generated text to the clipboard with one click.
- Configurable default directory for file selection.
- Configurable storage location for temporary history snapshots.

## Good for

- **LLM Context**: Easily gathering code snippets or text from multiple files to paste into LLM prompts (like ChatGPT,
  Claude, Gemini, Copilot etc.).
- **Generative AI Coding**: Providing accurate, multi-file context to AI coding tools.
- Quickly combining log files or text snippets.
- Reviewing previous sets of files and their combined content via history.

## How to use it

**Basic Concatenation for LLM Context:**

1. Open the FileKitty app.
2. Click **üìÇ Select Files** or **drag and drop** the source code or text files you need onto the app window.

3. The content from the selected files will appear combined in the main text area, formatted with Markdown code blocks (
   e.g., ```python ... ```).
4. Click **üìã Copy to Clipboard**.
5. Paste the combined content directly into your LLM chat or generative AI prompt.

**Using History:**

- Each time you change the file selection, Python symbol selection, or refresh, a history state is saved (if the text
  output differs).
- Use the **‚óÄ Back** and **‚ñ∂ Forward** buttons in the toolbar to step through past states.
- The toolbar shows your current position (e.g., "History 3 of 5").
- An indicator like `(Modified)` or `(Missing Files)` appears if the source files on disk no longer match the state you
  are viewing.

**Selecting Python Symbols:**

- If only Python (`.py`) files are selected, click **üîç Select Classes/Functions**.
- Choose specific symbols; the text area will update to show only those, plus relevant imports ‚Äì useful for focusing LLM
  context.

**Refreshing Content:**

- Click **üîÑ Refresh** to reload content from the files currently listed. This is useful if you edit files outside the
  app.

## Preferences

- Access via the "FileKitty" menu (Cmd+,).
- **Default 'Select Files' Directory**: Set the starting folder for the file dialog.
- **History Storage Directory**: Choose where FileKitty saves temporary history snapshots. Defaults to the system
  temporary location. Changing this clears existing history.

## Build

### Prerequisites

- Requires macOS.
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) is used for dependency management and building.

### Build from source

```bash
# Clone the repository
# cd FileKitty
poetry install
poetry run python setup.py py2app
```

- The application bundle (`FileKitty.app`) will be in `./dist/`.
- Copy `FileKitty.app` to your `/Applications` folder.

## Linting and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) for linting and code formatting.

### Run locally

```bash
make lint      # Check for lint issues
make format    # Format code
```

Or using poetry directly:

```bash
poetry run ruff check .
poetry run ruff format .
```

## Contributing

### Pre-commit hooks

This project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to enforce linting before each commit.

To set it up locally:

```bash
poetry install  # If not already done
pre-commit install
# Optional: check everything right away
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Continuous Integration

- **Linting**: Enforced via GitHub Actions on every push and pull request. See `.github/workflows/lint.yml`.
- **Build Validation**: Ensures the app builds correctly on macOS. See `.github/workflows/build.yml`.
